# Slack Wrapped
Slack web client wrapped up as an application.

## Why
Slack does not provide a linux client.
This is a simple wrapper around the slack web client that normally runs in
a browser.

## Downloads
Downloads are available on the [releases](https://github.com/pekim/slack-wrapped/releases) page.

## Features
* It's a linux client for slack!
* Themes (only a proof of concept so far)
* Open links in browser (or other system configured application)
* Spell checking and suggestions
  * spelling suggestions require that `hunspell` be installed and on the PATH
* Tray icon, with unread message count
* May work on Darwin and Windows (untested)

## Alternatives
* [slack-for-linux](https://github.com/wlaurance/slack-for-linux)
* [ScudCloud](https://github.com/raelgc/scudcloud)
