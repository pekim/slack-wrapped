# Slack Wrapped
Slack web client wrapped up as an application.

## Status
Experimental

## Why
Slack does not provide a linux client.
This is a simple wrapper around the slack web client that normally runs in
a browser.

## Features
* It's a linux client for slack!
* Themes (only a proof of concept so far)
* Open links in browser (or other system configured application)
* Tray icon, with unread message count
* May work on Darwin and Windows (untested)

## Alternatives
* [slack-for-linux](https://github.com/wlaurance/slack-for-linux)
* [ScudCloud](https://github.com/raelgc/scudcloud)

## Disclaimer
*Slack Wrapped is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Slack Technologies, Inc.*
